# National Social Determinants Analysis

1. [`NBGWAS.rmd`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/NBGWAS.rmd) contains code and explanation of national social determinants analysis. *Running time of this file is approximatedly 7 hours.

2. [`NBGWAS.R`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/NBGWAS.R) contains only the code and is designed to run with [`parasdwas.sh`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/parasdwas.sh) to shorten running time(~2H).

3. [`GWAS_P.rds`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/GWAS_P.rds) contains p-values(raw).
[`GWAS_ADJ_P.rds`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/GWAS_ADJ_P.rds) contains adjusted p-values using Benjamini-Hochberg. 
[`GWAS_MRR.rds`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/GWAS_MRR.rds) contains MRRs.

# States Social Determinants Analysis

1. [`states_NBGWAS.rmd`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/states_NBGWAS.rmd) contains code and explanation of states social determinants analysis.

2. [`states_NBGWAS.R`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/states_NBGWAS.R) contains only the code and is designed to run with [`sparanbsdwas.sh`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/sparanbsdwas.sh) to shorten running time.

3. [`state_results`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/GWAS/state_results) contains results of all states social determinants analysis.
