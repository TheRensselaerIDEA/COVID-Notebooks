The `data` folder contains most of the data. See `MM_data_formats.xlsx` in the `Documentation` folder for a more in-depth look. 

* `CDC` contains data about the deaths by cause of death that we got from the CDC website. 
* `CHR` contains the data about our social and economic factors that we obtained from County Health Records. 
* `Geo` contains geocodes for the states that are used to create the maps. 
* `RHI` contains data about more social and economic factors (specifically related to food and housing) that we obtained from the Rural Health Information Hub. 
* `Urban` contains data about the urbanization of each county.
