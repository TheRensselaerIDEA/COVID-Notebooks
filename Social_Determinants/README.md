# Social Determinants of COVID-19 mortality in the United States
This is the data repository for publicly available code and data to reproduce analyses created by IDEA HEALTH INCITE @ RPI during the summer of 2020.

# Librarian

[`Modules`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/Modules) includes the source file for libraries installation and loading.

# Raw Data

1. [`data`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/MergeSD/Social_Determinants/data)

2. [`Data`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/Data) includes all neccessary raw data to pass in preprocessing.

3. [`MM_data`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/MM_data) includes mortality data of several causes obtained from MortalityMinder.


# Preprocessing

1. [`Preprocessing`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/Preprocessing) includes the code to extract all necessary data and prepocess data for statistical analyses.

2. [`Preprocessing_FTS_Outputs`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/Preprocessing_FTS_Outputs) includes the aggregated dataframes from preprocessing.

# Analysis

1. [`Analyses`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/Analyses) contains scripts for national and state analysis model.

2. [`GWAS`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/GWAS) contains files to perform correlation study on COVID mortality.

# Analyses Results

1. [`TemporalResults`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/TemporalResults) contains results from temporal analysis with national model and R scripts for visualization.

2. [`StateSummaries`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/StateSummaries) contains analysis results from state model and aggregated data file.

3. [`AdjustedStateSummaries`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/AdjustedStateSummaries) contains aggregated data file after adjusting p-values from state analysis results.

# Visualization

[`Notebooks`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/Notebooks) contains several examples for types of figures that can be generated with the data.

R Notebook exists in [`ProtoNotebook.Rmd`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/Notebooks/ProtoNotebook.Rmd).  

# Parallelism

[`parana_fts.sh`](https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/tree/Social_Determinants/parana_fts.sh) is used to run R scripts on different dates in parrallel.


<b>Data: </b><br>

county_base_mortality.txt, county_old_mortality.txt: additional county-level socioeconomic and demographic variables from 2009-2016 
US CDC Compressed Mortality Data (https://wonder.cdc.gov/cmf-ICD10.html).

brfss_county_interpolated.csv: the county-level behavioral risk factor variables for 2011 US CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/).

<b>Additional Data Source: </b><br>
The county-level PM2.5 exposure data can be created via PM2.5 predictions from The Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group at Dalhouse University (http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~atmos/martin/). Please visit the detailed instructions below

The seasonal temperature and relative humidity data can be created via 4km Ã— 4km temperature and relative humidity predictions from Gridmet via google earth engine (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/IDAHO_EPSCOR_GRIDMET).

We thank John Abatzoglou and members of the Climatology Lab at University of Idaho for providing the GRIDMET open-source datasets.
