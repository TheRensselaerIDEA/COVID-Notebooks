A study found that people living in areas with high levels of social trust are less likely to rate their health status as fair or poor than people living in areas with low levels of social trust.

These health factors are influenced by programs and policies in place at the local, state, and federal levels. By looking at data related to Health Outcomes, we can get a glimpse at whether health improvement programs in a county are working. For example, a non-smoking ordinance in restaurants might impact smoking rates and ultimately lead to longer lives.


There are significant differences in health outcomes according to where we live, how much money we make, our race and ethnicity, and other characteristics.

Furthermore, social support networks have been identified as powerful predictors of health behaviors, suggesting that individuals without a strong social network are less likely to make healthy lifestyle choices than individuals with a strong network. A study found that people living in areas with high levels of social trust are less likely to rate their health status as fair or poor than people living in areas with low levels of social trust.

pct_fair_or_poor,Fair Or Poor Health,1,Percentage of adults reporting fair or poor health (age-adjusted).,http://bit.ly/2BYrY8W,Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/,"Self-reported health status is a general measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a population. Measuring HRQoL helps characterize the burden of disabilities and chronic diseases in a population. Self-reported health status is a widely used measure of people's health-related quality of life. In addition to measuring how long people live, it is important to also include measures that consider how healthy people are while alive.

The use of self-rated health as a measure to compare health status benefits from its comprehensive, inclusive, and non-specific nature. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the association between mortality and a single item assessing self-rated health found that people with 'poor' self-rated health had a twofold higher mortality risk than persons with 'excellent' self-rated health. This analysis concludes that a single measure that takes little time to collect and can be captured routinely is appropriate for measuring health among large populations. A study that investigated the reliability of the HRQoL questions included in BRFSS found high retest reliability for the self-reported health measure."

Stable, affordable housing can provide a safe environment for families to live, learn, grow, and form social bonds. However, housing is often the single largest expense for a family and when too much of a paycheck goes to paying the rent or mortgage, this housing cost burden can force people to choose among paying for other essentials such as utilities, food, transportation, or medical care.

Our collective health and well-being depend on opportunity for everyone. Yet, across and within counties there are stark differences in the opportunities to live in safe, affordable homes, especially for people with low incomes and people of color. These differences emerge from discrimination and institutional racism in the form of long-standing, deep-rooted and unfair systems, policies, and practices such as redlining, restrictive zoning rules, and predatory bank lending practices that reinforce residential segregation and barriers to opportunity.

A systematic review of the sexual risk among pregnant and mothering teens concludes that pregnancy is a marker for current and future sexual risk behavior and adverse outcomes. Pregnant teens are more likely than older women to receive late or no prenatal care, have eclampsia, puerperal endometritis, systemic infections, low birthweight, preterm delivery, and severe neonatal conditions. Pre-term delivery and low birthweight babies have increased risk of child developmental delay, illness, and mortality. Additionally, there are strong ties between teen birth and poor socioeconomic, behavioral, and mental outcomes. Teenage women who bear a child are much less likely to achieve an education level at or beyond high school, much more likely to be overweight/obese in adulthood, and more likely to experience depression and psychological distress."

High crime rates can also deter residents from pursuing healthy behaviors, such as exercising outdoors. Additionally, exposure to crime and violence has been shown to increase stress, which may exacerbate hypertension and other stress-related disorders and may contribute to obesity prevalence. Exposure to chronic stress also contributes to the increased prevalence of certain illnesses, such as upper respiratory illness, and asthma in neighborhoods with high levels of violence. Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data is generally regarded as a valid and reliable index of the types of crime residents view as serious events."
