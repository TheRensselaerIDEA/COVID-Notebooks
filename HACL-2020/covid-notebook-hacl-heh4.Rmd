## INTRODUCTION

This R Notebook and its related R scripts provide a very basic introduction to the **COVIDMINDER** application, which you can find at:

* Public "production" version: https://covidminder.idea.rpi.edu/

The github repository for all the code required for this notebook, including a snapshot of the **COVIDMINDER** application, can be found at:

* https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks

The **COVIDMINDER** github repository can be found at:

* https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVIDMINDER

**NOTE:** To contribute or submit to these repositories you must have a github.com ID and must send it to John Erickson at `erickj4@rpi.edu`. **PLEASE DO THIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE READING ANY FURTHER!!**

## HACL ASSIGNMENT 2: CLONING A NOTEBOOK AND UPDATING THE REPOSITORY

In this assignment we're asking you to...

* clone the `COVID-Notebook` github repository...
* create a personal branch using git, and...
* make additions to the repository by creating a new, customized notebook. 

The instructions which follow explain how to accomplish this. 

**For DAR/HACL Summer 2020** you *must* be using RStudio Server on the IDEA Cluster. Instructions for accessing "The Cluster" appear at the end of this notebook. Don't forget to send your github ID to `erickj4@rpi.edu` 

The recommended procedure for cloning and using this repository is as follows:

* Access RStudio Server on the IDEA Cluster at http://lp01.idea.rpi.edu/rstudio-ose/
* Access the Linux shell on the IDEA Cluster by clicking the **Terminal** tab of RStudio Server. `cd` into your home (login) directory using: `cd ~`
    * Advanced users may use `ssh` to directly access the Linux shell
* `git clone https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks.git` in your `home` directory, resulting in a new directory `COVID-Notebooks`
* In the Linux shell, `cd` to `COVID-Notebooks/HACL-2020` 
* In the Linux shell, `git checkout -b hacl-yourrcs` where `yourrcs` is your RCS id
    * For example, if your RCS is `erickj4`, your new branch should be `hacl-erickj4`
    * It is critical that you include your RCS id in your branch id
* In the RStudio Server UI, navigate to the `COVID-Notebooks/HACL-2020` directory via the **Files** panel
    * Set this to be your R working directory (under "More" menu)
* **REQUIRED**: 
    * Make a <b>copy</b> of this notebook (ie `covid-notebook-hacl.Rmd`) file using a *new, original, descriptive* filename that **includes your RCS ID!**
    * Edit your new notebook; save
    * Use the RStudio `knit` comment to creat an HTML file; repeat as necessary
    * In Linux, `git add` each new file you want to add to the repository, esp. your new `Rmd` file and the `html` you created when you knitted
    * When you're ready, in Linux: `git commit -a -m "some comment"` where "some comment" is a useful comment describing your changes
    * Finally, `git push origin hacl-yourrcs` (where `hacl-yourrcs` is the branch you're working on) 
* **REQUIRED**: On github, select your branch (from the branch drop-down) and submit a pull request.

**REQUIRED:** For this assignment you will be asked to confirm the following in LMS:

    * The location of the github: 
    * Your github ID:
    * The name of your new branch:
    * The location where you committed your new (copied) notebook:

Please also see this handy github "cheatsheet": https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf

## UNDERSTANDING THE DATA

* All of the data used for this notebook and the **COVIDMINDER** app is located in the `data/` directory hierarchy, mostly under `data/csv/` and `data/csv/time_series/`
* Feel free to browse the directory tree using RStudio or on the web via github
* Most of the nationwide data is under `data/csv`
* Most of the nationwide time series data and New York per-county data is under `data/csv/time_series/`
    * This layout may change
* We will be expanding our data archive, esp. using social determinatns data from <b>County Health Rankings</b>
    * See https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/explore-health-rankings/measures-data-sources/2020-measures 

## WHAT SHOULD I WORK ON?!?!?

* Choose an existing issue: https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Notebooks/issues
    * Ask questions about the issue in the "Comments" section of that issue
    * "Claim" the issue by self-assigning 
* OR, create your own issue; click "New Issue"
* OR, ask Prof. Bennett or Dr. Erickson for an issue to work on!

## HOW TO SHARE YOUR WORK OR ASK QUESTIONS

* For class-related questions, use the `data-incite-2020` slack channel under The Rensselaer IDEA
* For COVIDMINDER questions use the `idea_covidminder` stack channel 
    * Contact Dr. Erickson to be added (if you haven't already)

## WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR NOTEBOOK
* The code in your notebook should be well commented
* You should include thorough discussions of your methods and explanations of your results in the **markdown** sections (the non-code sections)
* You should always include enough detail for someone else to reproduce (and re-use!) your work!
* **ALWAYS* include useful titles and legends for your plots and tables!
* Nicely-formatted tables are always a bonus
* Your "default" for knitting notebooks should be HTML; this makes it easier to view and reduces errors.

### Text used for captions and explanations

ldi_explanation_text <- "<h4><b>EXPLANATION OF VISUALIZATIONS:</b></h4> The goal of these visualizations is to examine 
nationwide disparities in COVID-19 factors having to do with risks, mediations (e.g. testing, hospital beds), 
and outcomes (e.g. deaths, cases). A common measure, the <i>disparity index</i> is used to represent the 
difference between the observed rate in the state and some baseline rate.</p>
<p>The advantage of the disparity index is that represents how far off a target standard the observed rate is. </p>
<p>Mathematically,
<code>DI = log(x/y)</code> or <code>DI = log(y/x)</code>
depending upon whether being above or below the target is preferred. 
<ul>
<li>In the case of hospital beds or rate of testing, <i>x</i> would be some state's rate , and <i>y</i> would be the US rate or some rate 
we're comparing against (e.g. South Korea's testing or Italy's hospital beds).</li>
<li>In the case of mortality rates, <i>x</i> would be the target rate (e.g. some national rate, including the US), and <i>y</i> would be the individual state's rate.</li>
</ul>

## Accessing RStudio Server on the IDEA Cluster

The IDEA Cluster provides five compute nodes (4x 48 cores, 1x 80 cores, 1x storage server)

* RCS credentials (via registration in class); email John Erickson for problems `erickj4@rpi.edu`
* RStudio, Jupyter, MATLAB, GPUs (on two nodes); lots of storage and computes
* Access via RPI physical network or VPN only

RStudio GUI Access:

* http://lp01.idea.rpi.edu/rstudio-ose/  or http://lp01.idea.rpi.edu/rstudio-ose-3/ (RStudio)
* Linux terminal accessible from within RStudio "Terminal" or via ssh (below)

Shared Data on Cluster:

* All idea_users have access to shared storage via `/data` ("data" in your home directories)
* Shell access to nodes: You must access "landing pad" first, then compute node:
* `ssh your_rcs@lp01.idea.rpi.edu`  For example: `ssh erickj4@lp01.idea.rpi.edu`
* Then, `ssh` to the desired compute node, e.g.: `ssh idea-node-02`
